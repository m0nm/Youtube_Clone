fix videocard test
move channel image logic from videocard to fetch_from_youtube
finish sidebar functionality (may use zustand for category keyword: cats, dogs)

stop rerendering navbar and sidebar (maybe layout component as well)
don't forget to make a copy after deployment (for 404)
there should be two classes for card: one for home and second for related
finish testing (videocard skeleton loading not stopping)
